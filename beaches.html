        <h5 class="card-title">Fernandina Beach</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Imagine Victorian houses, brick buildings, and oak trees dripping with Spanish moss, and
          you’ll have Fernandina Beach about right. This friendly village is hidden in the northeast corner of Florida
          on Amelia Island, unique because eight different flags flew over it during its tumultuous past. Today, it
          offers miles of peaceful Atlantic beaches and historic landmarks that include the Palace Saloon — Florida’s
          oldest continuously operating bar -- and the Amelia Island Lighthouse, the state’s oldest working lighthouse.
          Make sure to visit Fort Clinch State Park, perfect for sunbathing, swimming, surf fishing and biking, as well
          as the aptly named Fantastic Fudge shop on Centre Street.

        <h5 class="card-title">Captiva Island</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Just west of Fort Myers Beach on Florida’s southwest Gulf coast, you’ll find Captiva
          Island, Sanibel’s smaller sister island. This tiny hamlet feels as if it’s been dusted with magic, and it’s
          apt to draw you under its spell. When you stroll through the town, you’ll discover a giant frog crouched in
          the garden of Jungle Drums Gallery, a giant’s chair that begs you to sit in it, and the Bubble Room, a
          restaurant where it’s Christmas all year long. Must-dos include searching for sea stars on the Island’s
          shell-strewn shores, and noshing on a grouper sandwich at RC Otters -- which is particularly tasty when
          enjoyed outside under the shade of an umbrella. The island embraces biking, birding, sailing, and water sports
          of all kinds.

        <h5 class="card-title">Madeira Beach</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Folks say Madeira Beach is two miles long and a smile wide, and the description rings true.
          Just a splash south of Clearwater Beach, this small town is quintessential old-time Florida, and flip-flops
          are the only footwear you'll need. John's Pass Village and Boardwalk, modeled after a fishing village, is a
          hub for area fun: it’s perfect for grabbing a bite, browsing for treasures in the quaint shops, or enjoying
          live local entertainment. The Village also offers a steady stream of events and activities such as sunset and
          dolphin cruises, parasailing and jet skiing. You’ll want to allow plenty of beach time; the sand is white and
          soft, and the water tends to be clear and calm. When you visit, you'll see why it's one of the best small
          towns in Florida near the beach.
